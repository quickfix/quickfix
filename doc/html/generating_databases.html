    <A NAME="MySQL Database">
    <H3>MySQL Database</H3>
    <p>
      First, make sure you have compiled QuickFIX with MySQL support.  If you have not done this,
      go back to the build instructions for your system and follow the instructions.  Also, make
      sure you have installed MySQL and have the deamon running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything needed to generate your MySQL database is in the <I>src/sql/mysql</I> directory. Here,
      there are the script and batch files <B>create.sh</B> and <B>create.bat</B>.
      These scripts will work on a newly installed mysql database with default permisions. The
      scripts will try to generate the database using the root MySQL account with no password. If
      you need to use a different account or need a password, you will have to edit the script.
      To select a different user, simply change 'root' to another user.  To add a password,
      use pass the -p <password> option after the username.
    </p>
    <A NAME="MSSQL Database">
    <H3>MSSQL Database</H3>
    <p>
      First, make sure you have compiled QuickFIX with MSSQL support.  If you have not done this,
      go back to the build instructions for your system and follow the instructions.  Also, make
      sure you have installed MSSQL and have the deamon running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything needed to generate your MSSQL database is in the <I>src/sql/mssql</I> directory. Here,
      there is the batch file <B>create.bat</B>.
      This script will work on a newly installed mssql database with default permisions. The
      scripts will try to generate the database using the sa account with no password. If
      you need to use a different account or need a password, you will have to edit the script.
      To select a different user, simply change 'sa' to another user.  To add a password,
      use pass the -P <password> option after the username.
    </p>
    <A NAME="PostgreSQL Database">
    <H3>PostgreSQL Database</H3>
    <p>
      First, make sure you have compiled QuickFIX with PostgreSQL support.  If you have not done this,
      go back to the build instructions for your system and follow the instructions.  Also, make
      sure you have installed PostgreSQL and have the deamon running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything needed to generate your PostgreSQL database is in the <I>src/sql/postgresql</I> directory. Here,
      there are the script and batch files <B>create.sh</B> and <B>create.bat</B>.
      These scripts will work on a newly installed postgresql database with default permisions. The
      scripts will try to generate the database using the postgres account with no password. If
      you need to use a different account or need a password, you will have to edit the script.
      To select a different user, simply change 'postgres' to another user.  To add a password,
      use pass the -W option and you will be prompted for a password.
