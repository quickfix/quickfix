1.4.0
-----
Support for FIX 4.3

New less redundant DataDictionary format, with support for component blocks

reset method on Session now available in JAVA and .NET API's

setNextSenderMsgSeqNum and setNextTargetMsgSeqNum available on session in all API's

Changes made to messages in toAdmin and toApp in JAVA are correctly applied when sending

sendToTarget throws SessionNotFound exception instead of just crashing under .NET

Fixed memory leaks in JNI interface

Fixed race condition between sending application and admin messages

Processing of Queue in ThreadedSocketConnection modified so it can better handle large
sustained throughput

.NET namespace changed from Fix to QuickFix. Resolves conflict with unmanaged FIX 
namespace allowing library to be used from VB.NET

Messages with repeating groups no longer take in the number of repeating groups in the
constructor.  This value was always overwritten when adding groups anyway.

1.3.2
-----
More portable file copies during build process on unix

1.3.1
-----
Fixed memory leak in repeating groups caused by FieldMap not calling clear() in destructor.

Corrected some minor errors building sample applications on some systems.

1.3.0
-----
Support for java on linux and solaris! Note some compilers/linux distributions
dont seem to do as well with this as others.

Added support for repeating groups in .NET and java APIs.

Event and message logging now available through the Log interface. This is
separate from the MessageStore which is now more acurately refered to as
a state mechanism.

MySQLFileStore added.  Now QuickFIX can maintain state in a production quality
open source database right out of the box.

--with-stlport configure option added for building with STLport.  This fixes stability 
problems that users have been experiencing on multi-processor machines with 2.95.x compilers.

Message decoding has been optimized. Decoding FIX messages is now 3 times faster than before.

Message class can now output FIX messages as XML.

Fixed copy operator for FieldMaps that contain repeating groups.

Fixed resource leaks in .NET API.  Message class should now be garbage collected correctly.
Also implemented IDisposable interface for Message. Be sure you know what you are doing
before using this!

DataDictionary parser works much better.  In particular it is able to 
generate the FIX40.xml and FIX41.xml files much more accurately.

Test Requests are now sent properly during times of high activity.

Test Request time span shortened for a timed out connection.

MessageStore sets and gets strings instead of messages. This allows the session to properly parse
stored messages using its data dictionary. The old way was causing problems with resends with 
repeating groups.

All MessageStore functions can now throw an IOException. If a session traps
an IOException it will consider it a serious problem and disconnect.

The get method in MessageStore that asks for a range is now a void method
instead of a boolean. If there is a problem retrieving a message, throw an
IOException.  If you are asked for a message you do not have, just send back
whatever is available within the range.

Faster load times for sessions that share a data dictionary. Each DataDictionary
file is now only parsed once on startup.

In JAVA booleans are properly represented as booleans instead of Strings

Currency types are properly represented as Strings

Rejecting a resent message will no longer increment the expected sequence number.

Can now properly accept a message with repeating group where the counter is set to zero.

Continuous builds now being run on windows-vc6, windows-vc7, and linux-pgcc-2-95-2, and
solaris-gcc-2-95-3-stlport

Message::getString() deprecated in favor of Message::toString()

1.2.1
-----
config.h no longer included from Utility.h.  This was causing problems when people wanted
to build quickfix application without autotools.

More robust detection of dropped/bad sockets. One of our users ran into a problem with this
during certification with the CME. He has confirmed that it works correctly now.

Closing acceptors now works in all situations.

Mutex locking in session is a little smarter, making it easier to syncrhonize applications.

code is now auto formatted with astyle. This makes it easier for people to contribute code
without having to worry as much about conforming to coding standards.

1.2.0
-----
First release of .NET API for QuickFIX. The API is mostly a direct port of the JAVA API,
future versions well attempt to refine this API to use more .NET specific constructs. QuickFIX
applications can now be written in C# or VB.NET or any other CLR language.

Documentation covers all API's, C++, Java, and .NET

New example application executor. Executor example is implemented in C++, Java and C#
for side by side comparison.

Fixed bug where the session time range was not calculated correctly when minutes or
seconds were involved. (.i.e., is that start time was set to 12:30:00, the 30 would
cause problems, wheras 12:00:00 would be fine).

Resend requests with EndSeqNo set to 0 (>=FIX 4.2) or 999999 (<=FIX 4.1) are now supported.

Possible duplicate messages with a sequence number that is too low will no longer be forwarded
to the application callback.

FIX Specification parser modified so it will now capture some fields that it was missing. The FIX42.xml
file in particular is more complete.

Made Java API more consistant with C++ API.

1.1.1
-----
Fixed memory leak caused by copying repeating groups.

Added acceptance tests for FIX 4.0 and 4.1

When new fields are added to the header or trailer portion of the XML data dictionary, 
QuickFIX will now handle them appropriately.

Header fields, not just body fields, can now be added to messages passing through toApp
and toAdmin callbacks

New setting CheckLatency and MaxLatency are available for session configuration. CheckLatency defaults
to Y and determines if a session will check if a message looks too old to process. MaxLatency
defaults to 120 and is the maximum number of seconds a message can be out of date and still
be considered good.

New setting ValidateFieldsOutOfOrder is available for session configuration. Sets whether or not header 
and body fields can be out of order. Useful for connecting to systems that don't properly sort their 
fields.

New setting LogonTimeout is availbale for session configuration. Number of seconds QuickFIX
will wait to receive a logon response. Defaults to 10.

Another fix put in to allow string based enumeration to be properly validated.

RefMsgType field no longer added to reject messages in versions earlier thatn 4.2

SequenceReset messages are now appropriately send with OrigSendingTime field.

RejectLogon, DoNotSend and UnsupportedMessageType exceptions added to JAVA interface.

New settings ResetOnLogout and ResetOnDisconnect will reset sequence numbers when a session
is respectively normally or abnormally terminated.

<string> is included from Exceptions.h, which makes QF compilable with STLPort.

1.1.0
-----
Added support for messages with repeating groups.

Added ThreadedSocketInitiator and ThreadedSocketAcceptor. Each session has it own thread 
for listening on a socket and one for processing messages.

The signature for toApp and toAdmin have changed from ( const Message&, const SessionID& )
to ( Message&, const SessionID& ). This allows applications to add fields to messages before
they are sent out. Particularly useful for administrative messages that need fields that arn't
added by default.

Filestore is much more memory efficient. Only file offsets are stored in memory
and messages are retreived on in as needed basis. This keeps memory use way
down and also is a little faster for normal operations.

On Linux and Solaris upgraded from libxml to libxml2. It is recomended by 
the libxml guys that all new applications use libxml2. configure will verify
that libxml is installed on a system and automatically add the necessary
command line parameters.

Possible duplicate messages are now passed to the fromAdmin and fromApp application
callbacks. Applications must now check for this field and determine how possible
duplicate messages should be handled.

Values.h correctly generated enumerations for fields of type INT.

Validation works with STRING enumerations, not just CHAR and INT.

Sockets are now properly closed if a connection fails. This fixes a leak in socket
resources that appeared after a large number of reconnect attempts.

RefTagID, RefMsgType are no longer added to reject message in versions of FIX 4.1 
and earlier. BusinessMessageReject no longer used in FIX versions 4.1 and earlier.

Improved DataDictionary generation. More enumerations are listed.
 
1.0.4
-----
Fixed bug in FileStore where .session file was overwritten on reload.

SocketInitiator now supports multiple alternate host and ports which allows
QuickFIX to take advantage of systems with failover servers.

Custom build step under windows is now compatible with Visual Studio 7.

Changed fields from template instantiated classes to standard classes in
order to stop Visual Studio 6 from crashing while in auto-complete mode.

Changed char pointer comparison operators for StringField to friend functions
so left hand side comparisons can be done such as "value" == senderCompID.

Began implementation of repeating groups.
	
1.0.3
-----
Added unit testing framework to ordermatch

Fixed bug in ordermatch where executing a partailly filled order resulted in
the order being left open with a negative ammount.

Added commands to standard input for ordermatch to list available symbols and
for displaying a book.

Began implementation of C API.

Added target field to order table in banzai.

Banzai can now properly handle receiving executions from multiple targets

1.0.2
-----
Fixed an incorrect number 84600 in FieldTypes.h with the
constant UTC_DAY which is the correct 86400

1.0.1
-----
Several classes deriving from FIX::Application had different throw specifiers 
than the base class.  This caused compilation errors with some compilers.  
This has been corrected.

FAQ has been updated.
