1.6.0
-----
FIX 4.4 support for C++ and Java APIs, with .NET on the way.  You can
technically use 4.4 with .NET now, but the generated message classes
are not yet available.

Messages with repeating groups will no longer be silenty ignored when 
no data dictionary is available.  QuickFIX will accept the message and 
send a proper reject message at validation.  Reject message will be
supplied for unspecified repeating tags, and count mismatches for
repeating groups.

ResendRequests are now done to INFINITY to reduce race condition
scenarios.

Out of sequence ResendRequest don't alter sequence numbers which
would cause race conditions during simultaneous ResendRequests.

Each C++ message is placed in its own file. This separation repairs
issues with Visual Studio running out of heap space.  This does mean,
however, that you will need to include the header for each individual
you intend on using instead of just including Messages.h

Fields of type MultipleValueString that have enumerations will check
each individual value instead of checking the string as a whole. For
instance if you are sent a MVS containing "A C 5", the validator will
verify that A C and 5 are all valid enumerations.

More descriptive error messages when reading invalid DataDictionary
files.  QuickFIX will no longer crash when givin a badly formatted
XML document, instead a ConfigError is thrown.

Repeating groups within Component are now read correctly from the
DataDictionary file.

DataDictionary will enforce that field names are unique.  This
prevents accidentally assigning two different field names to the
same tag number.

Fixed a bug where messages sent while logged off were not stored in
the MessageStore, causing them to never be resent.

By popular demand, the .NET API now exposes the isSetField call. This
allows .NET users to check for the presence of a field in a message.

Fixed bug where re-used Field classes would not recalculate their
length and checksum when their values changes, causing messages to
be sent out with incorrect lenths or checksums.

Fixed bug that cause the sendToTarget( Message, String, String )
signature would always fail from the Java API.

Fixed incomplete copy operator for DataDictionary.

ScreenLog now displays proper timestamps.

libxml2 can be linked into windows build as an alternative to MSXML.

Added accessor to Session class for the DataDictionary.

Banzai should load correctly with the supplied configuration file.

socket_t will be defined as int if not defined by the system. This
allows QF to be compiled on older systems such as Solaris 2.6

1.5.0
-----
Support for DATA fields. This will allow to safely send encrypted and
compressed fields.  Out of necessity, FIX parser uses the length field
instead of just looking for 10=SOH. This means behavior will be slightly
different when receiving messages with an incorrect length.

Acceptor and Initiator start() method is a non-blocking call. onRun
is no longer called in your application.  Instead you must call stop on
your initiator or acceptor when you want it to shut down.

Fixed several problems with parsing nested repeating groups and groups
with components.

Added UseDataDictionary field which defaults to Y. You must explicitly
set this field to N if you DONT want to use a DataDictionary.

New include structure for C++. Includes are now in the form of
quickfix/[file].h instead of the old quickfix/include/[file].h

Several optimizations added to increase the speed of creating, parsing,
and sending messages.  Overall performance of the engine should be
considerably better.  Messages with repeating groups should show dramatic 
performance increase.

All libraries are now build as shared libraries. This also doubles the speed
of the build under gcc because object files only need to be compiled once
instead of twice as before.

Header file dependencies have been reduced to speed up build. This may means
headers that were previously pulled in automatically via other header files,
may no longer do so.  You will now need to explicitly include these files where
needed.

Fixed some resource leaks when shutting down threads.

Added java acceptance tests. All FIX test scripts can now be run with
the runat_java and runat_java.bat commands in the test directory. FIX 4.3
tests now run with runat_threaded

Queued logon messages (logons messages received with sequence number to
high), are skipped when processing queue.

Build will pull CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and LDFLAGS in from the environment.
Default compiler flags are now -O2 -g. This may cause problems with some
older versions of gcc. Set CXXFLAGS to -O or blank if you have problems
compiling

Added new 'void toString( std::string& )' and 'void toXML( std::string& )' 
method calls. These are more efficient than 'string toString()' and
'string toXML' calls.  The new versions should be used if these methods
are called in a loop for better performance.

FileLog forcefully flushes writes so the state of the storage file is
always up to date.

1.4.1
-----
Fixed compilation errors when building under gcc 3.x (matching throw
specifiers, JNI patch).  Also got rid of warnings caused by generated
source files not ending with newlines.

getValue call in Java and .NET message class will throw and IncorrectDataFormat
exception instead of just crashing.  In C++, method also throws 
IncorrectDataFormat instead of FieldConvertError.

QuickFIX C++ call stack is available by running configure with the
--enable-callstack option, or defining USING_CALLSTACK in windows_config.h

Engine will no longer crash when specifying an invalid hostname

Added ConfigError throw specifier to Initiator/Acceptor start method. 

Removed ^M characters from install-sh which caused compile problems on
some systems.

Fixed code generation so groups withing components within groups are
show up in message classes.

Added missing SEQNUM type to DataDictionary.

Increased heap size for Visual Studio so heap allocation errors are
less likely when compiling.

In Java, renamed Session class to SessionSettings to match the C++ API

Fixed bug where session times would not ever reset when the start time
is greater than the end time.

Reentrant system calls are used when they are available. Fixed
unsynchronized resource bug on multi-processor machines.

Initiator and Acceptor use correct result after spawning thread,
instead of assigning the boolean result as the threadid.

Fixed deadlock in ThreadedSocketAcceptor and ThreadedSocketInitiator
when shutting down.

UtcDate now calls the correct constructor so it is initialized
properly.

Java MessageCracker now supports FIX 4.3 messages.

1.4.0
-----
Support for FIX 4.3

New less redundant DataDictionary format, with support for component blocks

reset method on Session now available in JAVA and .NET API's

setNextSenderMsgSeqNum and setNextTargetMsgSeqNum available on session in all API's

Changes made to messages in toAdmin and toApp in JAVA are correctly applied when sending

new throw specifiers on fromAdmin and fromApp message. Prevents
crashes from occuring when no data dictionary is used.

isSetField method added to JAVA API. Methods in version specific
messages also have methods to check if fields are set.

sendToTarget throws SessionNotFound exception instead of just crashing
under .NET

Fixed memory leaks in JNI interface

Fixed race condition between sending application and admin messages

Processing of Queue in ThreadedSocketConnection modified so it can
better handle large sustained throughput

.NET namespace changed from Fix to QuickFix. Resolves conflict with
unmanaged FIX namespace allowing library to be used from VB.NET

Messages with repeating groups no longer take in the number of
repeating groups in the constructor.  This value was always
overwritten when adding groups anyway.

The start method in Initiator and Acceptor can throw an exception if a
serious error occurs.

SocketAcceptor and ThreadedSocketAcceptor will no longer allow you to 
silently takeover a used port.  An exception will be thrown instead.

New constructor for SessionID takes strings.

New setting ValidateFieldsHaveValue can be set to N to prevent
rejecting messages with empty fields.

MySQL MessageStore will properly reset sequence numbers

Java field classes have final integers which identify the tag number
of the field.

Java and .NET will no longer crash when a incorrectly formatted field
is read from a session without a data dictionary.

1.3.2
-----
More portable file copies during build process on unix

1.3.1
-----
Fixed memory leak in repeating groups caused by FieldMap not calling
clear() in destructor.

Corrected some minor errors building sample applications on some systems.

1.3.0
-----
Support for java on linux and solaris! Note some compilers/linux distributions
dont seem to do as well with this as others.

Added support for repeating groups in .NET and java APIs.

Event and message logging now available through the Log interface. This is
separate from the MessageStore which is now more acurately refered to as
a state mechanism.

MySQLFileStore added.  Now QuickFIX can maintain state in a production quality
open source database right out of the box.

--with-stlport configure option added for building with STLport.  This
fixes stability problems that users have been experiencing on
multi-processor machines with 2.95.x compilers.

Message decoding has been optimized. Decoding FIX messages is now 3
times faster than before.

Message class can now output FIX messages as XML.

Fixed copy operator for FieldMaps that contain repeating groups.

Fixed resource leaks in .NET API.  Message class should now be garbage 
collected correctly. Also implemented IDisposable interface for
Message. Be sure you know what you are doing before using this!

DataDictionary parser works much better.  In particular it is able to 
generate the FIX40.xml and FIX41.xml files much more accurately.

Test Requests are now sent properly during times of high activity.

Test Request time span shortened for a timed out connection.

MessageStore sets and gets strings instead of messages. This allows
the session to properly parse stored messages using its data
dictionary. The old way was causing problems with resends with 
repeating groups.

All MessageStore functions can now throw an IOException. If a session traps
an IOException it will consider it a serious problem and disconnect.

The get method in MessageStore that asks for a range is now a void method
instead of a boolean. If there is a problem retrieving a message, throw an
IOException.  If you are asked for a message you do not have, just send back
whatever is available within the range.

Faster load times for sessions that share a data dictionary. Each 
DataDictionary file is now only parsed once on startup.

In JAVA booleans are properly represented as booleans instead of Strings

Currency types are properly represented as Strings

Rejecting a resent message will no longer increment the expected
sequence number.

Can now properly accept a message with repeating group where the
counter is set to zero.

Continuous builds now being run on windows-vc6, windows-vc7, and 
linux-pgcc-2-95-2, and solaris-gcc-2-95-3-stlport

Message::getString() deprecated in favor of Message::toString()

1.2.1
-----
config.h no longer included from Utility.h.  This was causing problems
when people wanted to build quickfix application without autotools.

More robust detection of dropped/bad sockets. One of our users ran
into a problem with this during certification with the CME. He has
confirmed that it works correctly now.

Closing acceptors now works in all situations.

Mutex locking in session is a little smarter, making it easier to
syncrhonize applications.

code is now auto formatted with astyle. This makes it easier for
people to contribute code without having to worry as much about
conforming to coding standards.

1.2.0
-----
First release of .NET API for QuickFIX. The API is mostly a direct
port of the JAVA API, future versions well attempt to refine this API
to use more .NET specific constructs. QuickFIX applications can now be
written in C# or VB.NET or any other CLR language.

Documentation covers all API's, C++, Java, and .NET

New example application executor. Executor example is implemented in
C++, Java and C# for side by side comparison.

Fixed bug where the session time range was not calculated correctly
when minutes or seconds were involved. (.i.e., is that start time was
set to 12:30:00, the 30 would cause problems, wheras 12:00:00 would be fine).

Resend requests with EndSeqNo set to 0 (>=FIX 4.2) or 999999 (<=FIX
4.1) are now supported.

Possible duplicate messages with a sequence number that is too low
will no longer be forwarded to the application callback.

FIX Specification parser modified so it will now capture some fields
that it was missing. The FIX42.xml file in particular is more complete.

Made Java API more consistant with C++ API.

1.1.1
-----
Fixed memory leak caused by copying repeating groups.

Added acceptance tests for FIX 4.0 and 4.1

When new fields are added to the header or trailer portion of the XML
data dictionary, QuickFIX will now handle them appropriately.

Header fields, not just body fields, can now be added to messages
passing through toApp and toAdmin callbacks

New setting CheckLatency and MaxLatency are available for session 
configuration. CheckLatency defaults to Y and determines if a session
will check if a message looks too old to process. MaxLatency defaults
to 120 and is the maximum number of seconds a message can be out of
date and still be considered good.

New setting ValidateFieldsOutOfOrder is available for session
configuration. Sets whether or not header and body fields can be out
of order. Useful for connecting to systems that don't properly sort their 
fields.

New setting LogonTimeout is availbale for session configuration. 
Number of seconds QuickFIX will wait to receive a logon response. 
Defaults to 10.

Another fix put in to allow string based enumeration to be properly validated.

RefMsgType field no longer added to reject messages in versions
earlier than 4.2

SequenceReset messages are now appropriately send with OrigSendingTime field.

RejectLogon, DoNotSend and UnsupportedMessageType exceptions added to
JAVA interface.

New settings ResetOnLogout and ResetOnDisconnect will reset sequence
numbers when a session is respectively normally or abnormally terminated.

<string> is included from Exceptions.h, which makes QF compilable with STLPort.

1.1.0
-----
Added support for messages with repeating groups.

Added ThreadedSocketInitiator and ThreadedSocketAcceptor. Each session
has its own thread for listening on a socket and one for processing messages.

The signature for toApp and toAdmin have changed from 
   ( const Message&, const SessionID& )
to ( Message&, const SessionID& ). 
This allows applications to add fields to messages before they are sent out. 
Particularly useful for administrative messages that need fields that arn't
added by default.

Filestore is much more memory efficient. Only file offsets are stored in memory
and messages are retreived on in as needed basis. This keeps memory use way
down and also is a little faster for normal operations.

On Linux and Solaris upgraded from libxml to libxml2. It is recomended by 
the libxml guys that all new applications use libxml2. configure will verify
that libxml is installed on a system and automatically add the necessary
command line parameters.

Possible duplicate messages are now passed to the fromAdmin and
fromApp application callbacks. Applications must now check for this
field and determine how possible duplicate messages should be handled.

Values.h correctly generated enumerations for fields of type INT.

Validation works with STRING enumerations, not just CHAR and INT.

Sockets are now properly closed if a connection fails. This fixes a
leak in socket resources that appeared after a large number of
reconnect attempts.

RefTagID, RefMsgType are no longer added to reject message in versions
of FIX 4.1 and earlier. BusinessMessageReject no longer used in FIX
versions 4.1 and earlier.

Improved DataDictionary generation. More enumerations are listed.
 
1.0.4
-----
Fixed bug in FileStore where .session file was overwritten on reload.

SocketInitiator now supports multiple alternate host and ports which allows
QuickFIX to take advantage of systems with failover servers.

Custom build step under windows is now compatible with Visual Studio 7.

Changed fields from template instantiated classes to standard classes in
order to stop Visual Studio 6 from crashing while in auto-complete mode.

Changed char pointer comparison operators for StringField to friend functions
so left hand side comparisons can be done such as "value" == senderCompID.

Began implementation of repeating groups.
	
1.0.3
-----
Added unit testing framework to ordermatch

Fixed bug in ordermatch where executing a partailly filled order resulted in
the order being left open with a negative ammount.

Added commands to standard input for ordermatch to list available symbols and
for displaying a book.

Began implementation of C API.

Added target field to order table in banzai.

Banzai can now properly handle receiving executions from multiple targets

1.0.2
-----
Fixed an incorrect number 84600 in FieldTypes.h with the
constant UTC_DAY which is the correct 86400

1.0.1
-----
Several classes deriving from FIX::Application had different throw specifiers 
than the base class.  This caused compilation errors with some compilers.  
This has been corrected.

FAQ has been updated.
