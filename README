This is a fork to meet my requirements. If you have no specific requirements fulfilled by this fork, then it would be better to use the original. It may be of interest when:

1. SSL connections are required.

2. SunOS or AIX are platforms of interest.

3. Order of fields/tags for outgoing messages is important (configurable, not on by default).

4. There is also some EMX platform related functionality which can be enabled through
a compile flag.

5. Arbitrary precision (upto nanoseconds) timestamps need to be handled.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING

    Full instructions:
        See doc/html/building.html

    Quick instructions:
        ./bootstrap
        ./configure
        make
        make check
        sudo make install


For SunOS and AIX have a look at README.SunOS and README.AIX.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to build many components with a relatively newer version of cmake.


For example on Windows,

mkdir build
cd build
cmake  -DHAVE_SSL=ON -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=C:\github\test\quickfix\install-cmake -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR="path to openssl" ..
Then build in Visual Studio or on command prompt.


On Linux (with system openssl),

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DHAVE_SSL=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/nkoak/swissrisk/github/quickfix-stuff/quickfix/install-cmake ..
make -j 4 install


If one has Ninja then (with system openssl),

cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DHAVE_SSL=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/nkoak/swissrisk/github/quickfix-stuff/quickfix/install-cmake ..
ninja install
